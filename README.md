# **Data Visualization Task**

This project is part of a Data Science internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**, where I focused on creating visualizations to explore and understand a dataset. The goal was to analyze the distribution of various categorical and continuous variables using Pythonâ€™s visualization libraries.

## **Project Description**

The dataset used in this project includes information such as **age**, **gender**, **education**, and **income levels**. The primary task was to represent these variables through **pie charts** and other visualization techniques to gain insights into the data distribution.

### **Key Objectives:**
1. Explore and clean the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy for visualization.
2. Visualize categorical variables (such as gender and income) using **pie charts**.
3. Utilize **subplots** for organizing multiple charts in a clear, readable layout.
4. Demonstrate the importance of data visualization in understanding complex datasets.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Python**: For data analysis and scripting.
- **Pandas**: To handle data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For building the visualizations and creating plots.

## **How to Use the Project**

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-visualization-task.git
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies** (ensure you have Python installed):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    - Open the notebook in Jupyter to view the code and visualizations:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook task1.ipynb
      ```

4. **Explore the visualizations**:
    - The notebook contains the steps to clean and visualize the dataset. Run each cell to generate the plots.

## **Project Insights**

- **Understanding distributions**: The pie charts created show the breakdown of gender and income in the dataset, providing a clear visual understanding of the data.
- **Subplots**: Using subplots helped organize multiple charts into a single view, making it easier to compare distributions side by side.
- **Data cleaning**: I handled missing data to ensure that the visualizations were based on complete and accurate information.

## **Learnings & Future Work**
This project was a great introduction to data visualization using Python. Moving forward, I plan to:
- Experiment with other chart types such as **histograms** and **box plots** for deeper insights.
- Analyze relationships between variables like age and income using scatter plots and heatmaps.
- Explore more complex datasets and try out additional libraries such as **Seaborn** and **Plotly** for interactive visualizations.

## **Why Visualization Matters**
Data visualization is a powerful tool that helps to make sense of raw data by revealing trends, patterns, and outliers. It bridges the gap between complex data and actionable insights, making it easier to communicate findings to others, regardless of technical expertise.
