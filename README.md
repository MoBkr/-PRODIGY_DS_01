Data Visualization Project
This repository contains a data visualization task completed as part of my Data Science internship with Prodigy InfoTech. The project focuses on exploring and visualizing the distribution of different variables from a dataset.

Project Overview
In this task, I worked with a dataset that includes variables such as age, gender, education, and income level. I used Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib library to create various visualizations, which help to understand the data and reveal trends or patterns.

Task 1/5: Visualization of Categorical and Continuous Variables
The first task was to create visualizations of both categorical and continuous variables to represent their distribution. Specifically, I:

Explored the dataset to understand the structure and contents.
Created pie charts to visualize the distribution of categorical variables such as gender and income.
Utilized subplots to display multiple visualizations in an organized manner.
Skills and Tools Used
Python: Main programming language used for data manipulation and visualization.
Matplotlib: Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Key Learnings
How to effectively clean and explore datasets before analysis.
Techniques for visualizing categorical data using pie charts.
The importance of organizing multiple visualizations using subplots for clarity.
